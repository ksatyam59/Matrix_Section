# Sort-the-matrix
Given a n x n matrix. The problem is to sort the given matrix in strict order. Here strict order means that matrix is sorted in a way such that all elements in a row are sorted in increasing order and for row ‘i’, where 1 &lt;= i &lt;= n-1, first element of row 'i' is greater than or equal to the last element of row 'i-1'.
